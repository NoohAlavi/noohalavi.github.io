                Hello, World! Today's Saturday, the first of May, and I've just finished implementing blogs to the website, so I decided it would be an appropriate time to make my first post as well. In this post, I'll just be talking about why I made the website, and what's the come. <br><br>

                <h3>Who Am I?</h3>

                A quick introduction - I'm a highschooler who's been coding for over four years, and a hobbyist programmer and game developer. I've also got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2W0dJwYSOHm4Rn1p17P6qg">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://twitch.tv/opsci">Twitch</a> channel, in which I produce a variety of content. Not gonna put a full bio here, but If you guys want more infomation, feel free to check out the <a href="../about-me.html">About Me Page</a>.<br><br>

                <h3>Why Did I Make This Website?</h3>

                Tons of reasons, mainly boredom. However, I'm also planning on using this site as a platform to post my projects, devlogs, etc. Maybe later on, I could even use this site as a portfolio or something. And if I ever make a game which ends up getting kind of big, then I could maybe implement forums and/or feedback and bug reports right into this site, though I'll probably use GitHub for that.<br><br>

                <h3>Alright, You Made The Website, Cool, Now What?</h3>

                "What's coming next, " you might be asking. Well, At the time of publishing this article, I still have to finish the homepage and projects page. But some ideas that I might implement are -
                <ul>
                    <li>A comment section on the blogs - <i>I know theres some way to implement this using GitHub, so I'm gonna look into it. Hopefully, you'll be able to leave comments here soon!</i></li>
                    <li>Maybe some sort of forum? - <i>This one, I'm not too sure about. But we'll see!</i></li>
                    <li>Dark mode - <i>I'm a programmer, and all (sane) programmers have a positive relationship with dark mode. So, I'll probably add a dark-light mode toggle in the future. Right now though, I'm focusing on more important things, like actually finishing the page xD</i></li>
                </ul>
                Also, what about the blogs? What will those be about? Well, I was thinking I could post many different kinds of blogs, such as
                <ul>
                    <li>Tutorials - <i>I could make tutorials for all sorts of engines and languages, and maybe even make accompanying videos on my YouTube channel for those who prefer watching over reading.</i></li>
                    <li>Devlogs - <i>If I write devlogs, I feel like that will motivate me more to finish a game.</i></li>
                    <li>Updates - <i>To the site or to any one of my projects. This blog itself could be considered an "Update" blog</i></li>
                    <li>Maybe even rants - <i>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</i></li>
                </ul>
                If you guys have any other ideas, feel free to tell me on my <a href="https://discord.gg/vxvKSvd">Discord server</a>. That's it from me for today, I'll see y'all later.
