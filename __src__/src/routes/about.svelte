<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>&emsp;&emsp; Hey! My name is Nooh Alavi, and I'm just a kid who likes coding and game development! I made this site as a place to post my projects, videos, tutorials, devlogs and thoughts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; I started coding in fourth grade, when I picked up a book on HTML and CSS in my school book fair. My dream since I was a kid was making my own video games, and that dream could finally come true - but not yet. I soon discovered HTML wasnt.. well... <i>ideal</i> for making video games. However, that book inspired me to learn other coding languages.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; Soon, I learned Python and JavaScript, and made a few simple games. I remember making clones of games such as Snake, Space Invaders, etc, and a few other unoriginal ideas, such as an infinite runner (with terrible collision detection), and a game where you had to avoid falling objects from the sky (at that point, I had learned the AABB algorithm, and could actually implement proper collision detection).</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; And then, I found out about game engines, which was literally game changing for me. I tried out a couple, including Unity, Phaser.js, Love2D, and even explored some fantasy consoles, but in the end I stuck with Godot, a decision I don't regret.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; Now, I make most of my games using Godot with the C# scripting language, though I always love learning and trying out new languages and tools! I post devlogs, tutorials and my discoveries</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; But coding and gamedev aren't my only hobbies! I love playing many different video games, including Minecraft, Among Us and chess, and I stream them on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/opsci">my twitch channel</a>.</p>
