**NOOHALAVI.GITHUB.IO**

This is the code for my personal website https://noohalavi.github.io/, written using vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript. The website is a hobby project that I made, where I'm going to post my games, projects, write blogs, etc. More information can be found at https://noohalavi.github.io/posts/hello-world.

_Please note that this site is currently a major **Work In Progress**. Many features will be unfinished or broken. Feel free to report any bugs in my discord server https://discord.gg/vxvKSvd._

Shoutout to (@darkxception) [https://github.com/darkxception] for contributing, and helping with the CSS! You're an absolute legend :D
