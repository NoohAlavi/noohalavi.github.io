            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Hey there! My name's Nooh Alavi, and I'm just a teen who loves coding and game development. I made this site as a place to post my projects, videos, tutorials, devlogs and thoughts.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; I started coding in fourth grade, when I picked up a book on HTML and CSS in my school book fair. My dream since I was a kid was making my own video games, and that dream could finally come true - but not yet. I soon discovered HTML wasnt.. well... <i>ideal</i> for making video games. However, that book inspired me to learn other coding languages. And hey, I'm guess I used HTML to make this page, so I guess that book did indeed help me.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; Soon, I learned Python and JavaScript, and made a few simple games. I remember making clones of games such as Snake, Space Invaders, etc, and a few other unoriginal ideas, such as an infinite runner (with terrible collision detection), and a game where you had to avoid falling objects from the sky (at that point, I had learned the AABB algorithm, and could actually implement proper collision detection).</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; And then, I found out about game engines, which was literally game changing for me. I tried out a couple, including Unity, Phaser.js, Love2D, and even explored some fantasy consoles, but in the end I stuck with <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a>, a decision I don't regret.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; Now, I make most of my games using Godot with the C# scripting language, though I always love learning and trying out new languages and tools! I post devlogs, tutorials and my discoveries on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2W0dJwYSOHm4Rn1p17P6qg">my youtube channel</a>.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; But coding and gamedev aren't my only hobbies! I love playing many different video games with friends, including Minecraft, Among Us and chess, and I stream them on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/opsci">my twitch channel</a>.</p>
